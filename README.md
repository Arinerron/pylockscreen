# About

`pylockscreen` is a modular, Python-based, modern i3lock / i3lock-fancy / i3lock-fancy-multimonitor alternative

# Project Goals

I don't like existing solutions. The goal for this project is to be:
- modular and easy to configure
- be modern in the sense that it has support for technologies like fingerprint sensors by default
- as pretty (or more pretty) than i3lock-fancy

# Installation

## Manual

```
$ git clone git@github.com:Arinerron/pylockscreen.git
$ cd pylockscreen
# ./setup.py install
```
